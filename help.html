        <h1 class="maintext">Yahtzee Tutorial</h1>
        <p class="bread">To play yahtzee on this website you need pen and paper to save your scores. Ideally you get a yahtzee sheet online. <br>
            Bear in mind that you are not supposed to play same scoring twice. For example you cannot score chance twice when you're playing.<br>
            So if you were to get two ones, score two points and then the next turn you get a single one, you cannot score the single point because you've
            already used up that slot. Though you can score ones on a new slot if you were to get them as three or four pairs as
            three of a kind or four of a kind, but here aswell, only once.<br></p>

            <p class="bread">The primary rules you need to remember for this program is how straights, yahtzee and full house work:<br><br>
            Full house: Three of a kind and two of another kind. Gives 25 points.<br>
            Small Straight: Ladder of four numbers. Ex. 1-2-3-4 or 2-3-4-5 or 3-4-5-6. Gives 30 points<br>
            Large Straight: Ladder of four numbers. Ex. 1-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-6. Gives 40 points<br>
            Yahtzee: Five of a kind gives 50 points automatically!<br>
            Also bear in mind that this program is a work in progress, therefore we haven't developed a way<br>
            for you to skip the turn when you are content with you score. If you are certain of your score just lock<br>
            all dices in and roll out until you get the reset button. In time an extra reset button without conditions will be added.<br><br>
            When it comes to pairs and chance, the most common score you'll get on a game of yahtzee,<br>
            the game shows you those scores so you don't need to calculate anything while playing.
